	abstract = {Epilepsy is an electrophysiological disorder of the brain, characterized by recurrent seizures. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a test that measures and records the electrical activity of the brain, and is widely used in the detection and analysis of epileptic seizures. However, it is often difﬁcult to identify subtle but critical changes in the EEG waveform by visual inspection, thus opening up a vast research area for biomedical engineers to develop and implement several intelligent algorithms for the identiﬁcation of such subtle changes. Moreover, the EEG signals are nonlinear and non-stationary in nature, which contribute to further complexities related to their manual interpretation and detection of normal and abnormal (interictal and ictal) activities. Hence, it is necessary to develop a Computer Aided Diagnostic (CAD) system to automatically identify the normal and abnormal activities using minimum number of highly discriminating features in classiﬁers. It has been found that nonlinear features are able to capture the complex physiological phenomena such as abrupt transitions and chaotic behavior in the EEG signals. In this review, we discuss various feature extraction methods and the results of different automated epilepsy stage detection techniques in detail. We also brieﬂy present the various open ended challenges that need to be addressed before a CAD based epilepsy detection system can be set-up in a clinical setting.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In this study, the magnitude and spatial distribution of beta power in the resting electroencephalogram (EEG) were examined to address the possibility of an excitation-inhibition imbalance in the central nervous system of alcoholics.
METHODS: Log transformed absolute power in the Beta 1 (12.5-16 Hz), Beta 2 (16.5-20 Hz), and Beta 3 (20.5-28 Hz) bands in the eyes-closed EEG of 307 alcohol-dependent subjects and 307 unaffected age- and gender-matched control subjects were compared using a multivariate repeated measures design. Effect of gender, age, and drinking variables was examined separately.
RESULTS: Increased Beta 1 (12.5-16 Hz) and Beta 2 (16.5-20 Hz) absolute power was observed in alcohol-dependent subjects at all loci over the scalp. The increase was most prominent in the central region. Increased Beta 3 (20.5-28 Hz) power was frontal in the alcoholics. Age and clinical variables did not influence the increase. Male alcoholics had significantly higher beta power in all three bands. In female alcoholics the increase did not reach statistical significance.
CONCLUSIONS: Beta power in all three bands of resting EEG is elevated in alcoholics. This feature is more prominent in male alcoholics. The increased beta power in the resting EEG may be an electrophysiological index of the imbalance in the excitation-inhibition homeostasis in the cortex.},

	abstract = {Purpose – This paper seeks to explore the implementation of knowledge management in a telecommunication multinational subsidiary and to investigate factors that affect the performance as well as the impacts. Design/methodology/approach – Innovation perspective informs the identification of the ways in which KM strategies are devised and put into action. Using in‐depth interviews and direct observation, the paper maps some problems associated with the strategy and implementation of KM. Findings – The case shows that the lack of organisation‐wide integrated systems, which is typical across different organisations, does contribute to this problem. However, the main predicament lies with the fact that a KM‐enabling scheme is never explicitly prioritised in the organisation's information systems strategy. Practical implications – KM implementation should take into account both technological innovation and organisational innovation. Neglecting one aspect poses apparent danger that the implementation is unlikely to bring about benefit to the organisation. Originality/value – This paper presents the case of a multinational company subsidiary in a developing economy, i.e. Indonesia. It is expected that this case will help substantiate an instance of KM implementation in an emerging economy and latecomer development, which might impact the operation and working of a multinational subsidiary.},

The data on project management activities were collected in order to measure the amount of work completed, compliance with the release and iteration plans, and ability of effort estimation, thus contributing to evidence-based assessment of the typical Scrum processes. It was found that the initial plans and effort estimates were over-optimistic, but the abilities of estimating and planning improved from Sprint to Sprint. Most teams were able to define almost accurate Sprint plans after three Sprints. In the third Sprint the velocity stabilized and the actual achievement almost completely matched the plan.

Its benefits include a firm statistical foundation and a probabilistic model useful for “explaining” the data. There is a perception that LR is slow, unstable, and unsuitable for large learning or classification tasks. Through fast approximate numerical methods, regularization to avoid numerical instability, and an efficient implementation we will show that LR can outperform modern algorithms like Support Vector Machines (SVM) on a variety of learning tasks. Our novel implementation, which uses a modified iteratively re-weighted least squares estimation procedure, can compute model parameters for sparse binary datasets with hundreds of thousands of rows and attributes, and millions or tens of millions of nonzero elements in just a few seconds.

Currently, in many real-world applications, highdimensional data pose a major challenge to conventional NB classiﬁers, due to noisy or redundant features and local relevance of these features to classes. In this paper, an automated feature weighting solution is proposed to result in a NB method eﬀective in dealing with high-dimensional data. We ﬁrst propose a locally weighted probability model, for Bayesian modeling in high-dimensional spaces, to implement a soft feature selection scheme. Then we propose an optimization algorithm to ﬁnd the weights in linear time complexity, based on the Logitnormal priori distribution and the Maximum a Posteriori principle. Experimental studies show the eﬀectiveness and suitability of the proposed model for high-dimensional data classiﬁcation.},

We show that this new approach can be interpreted as a repeated application of Donoho's original method. The main feature is, however, a dramatically improved noise reduction compared to Donoho's approach, both in terms of the l{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} error and visually, for a large class of signals.

	abstract = {Background and objective: 
For more than 20 years, Higuchi's fractal dimension (HFD), as a nonlinear method, has occupied an important place in the analysis of biological signals. The use of HFD has evolved from EEG and single neuron activity analysis to the most recent application in automated assessments of different clinical conditions. Our objective is to provide an updated review of the HFD method applied in basic and clinical neurophysiological research.

Methods:
This article summarizes and critically reviews a broad literature and major findings concerning the applications of HFD for measuring the complexity of neuronal activity during different neurophysiological conditions. The source of information used in this review comes from the PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar and IEEE Xplore Digital Library databases.

Results:
The review process substantiated the significance, advantages and shortcomings of HFD application within all key areas of basic and clinical neurophysiology. Therefore, the paper discusses HFD application alone, combined with other linear or nonlinear measures, or as a part of automated methods for analyzing neurophysiological signals.

Conclusions:
The speed, accuracy and cost of applying the HFD method for research and medical diagnosis make it stand out from the widely used linear methods. However, only a combination of HFD with other nonlinear methods ensures reliable and accurate analysis of a wide range of neurophysiological signals.},

	abstract = {Principal component analysis of a data matrix extracts the dominant patterns in the matrix in terms of a complementary set of score and loading plots. It is the responsibility of the data analyst to formulate the scientific issue at hand in terms of PC projections, PLS regressions, etc. Ask yourself, or the investigator, why the data matrix was collected, and for what purpose the experiments and measurements were made. Specify before the analysis what kinds of patterns you would expect and what you would find exciting. The results of the analysis depend on the scaling of the matrix, which therefore must be specified. Variance scaling, where each variable is scaled to unit variance, can be recommended for general use, provided that almost constant variables are left unscaled. Combining different types of variables warrants blockscaling. In the initial analysis, look for outliers and strong groupings in the plots, indicating that the data matrix perhaps should be “polished” or whether disjoint modeling is the proper course. For plotting purposes, two or three principal components are usually sufficient, but for modeling purposes the number of significant components should be properly determined, e.g. by cross-validation. Use the resulting principal components to guide your continued investigation or chemical experimentation, not as an end in itself.},

	abstract = {Emotions are often perceived by humans through a series of multimodal cues, such as verbal expressions, facial expressions and gestures. In order to recognise emotions automatically, reliable emotional labels are required to learn a mapping from human expressions to corresponding emotions. Dimensional emotion models have become popular and have been widely applied for annotating emotions continuously in the time domain. However, the statistical relationship between emotional dimensions is rarely studied. This paper provides a solution to automatic emotion recognition for the Audio/Visual Emotion Challenge (AVEC) 2018. The objective is to find a robust way to detect emotions using more reliable emotion annotations in the valence and arousal dimensions. The two main contributions of this paper are: 1) the proposal of a new approach capable of generating more dependable emotional ratings for both arousal and valence from multiple annotators by extracting consistent annotation features; 2) the exploration of the valence and arousal distribution using outlier detection methods, which shows a specific oblique elliptic shape. With the learned distribution, we are able to detect the prediction outliers based on their local density deviations and correct them towards the learned distribution. The proposed method performance is evaluated on the RECOLA database containing audio, video and physiological recordings. Our results show that a moving average filter is sufficient to remove the incidental errors in annotations. The unsupervised dimensionality reduction approaches could be used to determine a gold standard annotations from multiple annotations. Compared with the baseline model of AVEC 2018, our approach improved the arousal and valence prediction of concordance correlation coefficient significantly to respectively 0.821 and 0.589.},

Theoretical results indicate that the method preserves distances quite nicely; however, empirical results are sparse. We present experimental results on using random projection as a dimensionality reduction tool in a number of cases, where the high dimensionality of the data would otherwise lead to burden-some computations. Our application areas are the processing of both noisy and noiseless images, and information retrieval in text documents. We show that projecting the data onto a random lower-dimensional subspace yields results comparable to conventional dimensionality reduction methods such as principal component analysis: the similarity of data vectors is preserved well under random projection. However, using random projections is computationally significantly less expensive than using, e.g., principal component analysis. We also show experimentally that using a sparse random matrix gives additional computational savings in random projection.},

The study develops a novel framework for investigating and comparing the relative performance of BSS algorithms that incorporates a realistic EEG simulation with a known mixture of known signals and an objective performance metric. The key ﬁnding is that although BSS is an effective and powerful tool for separating and removing contamination from EEG, the quality of the separation is highly dependant on the type of contamination, the degree of contamination, and the choice of BSS algorithm. BSS appears to be most effective at separating muscle and blink contamination and less effective at saccadic and tracking contamination. For all types of contamination, principal components analysis is a strong performer when the contamination is greater in amplitude than the brain signal whereas other algorithms such as second-order blind inference and Infomax are generally better for speciﬁc types of contamination of lower amplitude.},

This study reports on the presence of transient electroencephalography (EEG)-based measures of brain activity during motor imagery in spinal cord–injured patients with CNP. We analyzed dynamic EEG responses during imaginary movements of arms and legs in 3 groups of 10 volunteers each, comprising able-bodied people, paraplegic patients with CNP (lower abdomen and legs), and paraplegic patients without CNP. Paraplegic patients with CNP had increased event-related desynchronization in the theta, alpha, and beta bands (16–24 Hz) during imagination of movement of both nonpainful (arms) and painful limbs (legs). Compared to patients with CNP, paraplegics with no pain showed a much reduced power in relaxed state and reduced event-related desynchronization during imagination of movement. Understanding these complex dynamic, frequency-specific activations in CNP in the absence of nociceptive stimuli could inform the design of interventional therapies for patients with CNP and possibly further understanding of the mechanisms involved.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Perspective{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}This study compares the EEG activity of spinal cord–injured patients with CNP to that of spinal cord–injured patients with no pain and also to that of able-bodied people.

People with SCI and rodent models of SCI develop above-level pain characterized by mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia. Mechanisms underlying this pain are unknown and the goals of this study were to elucidate components contributing to the generation of above-level CNP. Following a thoracic (T10) contusion, forelimb nociceptors had enhanced spontaneous activity and were sensitized to mechanical and thermal stimulation of the forepaws 35 days post-injury. Cervical dorsal horn neurons showed enhanced responses to non-noxious and noxious mechanical stimulation as well as thermal stimulation of receptive fields. Immunostaining dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cells and cord segments with activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3, a marker for neuronal injury) ruled out neuronal damage as a cause for above-level sensitization since few C8 DRG cells expressed AFT3 and cervical cord segments had few to no ATF3-labeled cells. Finally, activated microglia and astrocytes were present in thoracic and cervical cord at 35 days post-SCI, indicating a rostral spread of glial activation from the injury site. Based on these data, we conclude that peripheral and central sensitization as well as reactive glia in the uninjured cervical cord contribute to CNP. We hypothesize that reactive glia in the cervical cord release pro-inflammatory substances which drive chronic CNP.

	abstract = {Objectives: To create a classiﬁer based on electroencephalography (EEG) to identify spinal cord injured (SCI) participants at risk of developing central neuropathic pain (CNP) by comparing them with patients who had already developed pain and with able bodied controls.
Methods: Multichannel EEG was recorded in the relaxed eyes opened and eyes closed states in 10 able bodied participants and 31 subacute SCI participants (11 with CNP, 10 without NP and 10 who later developed pain within 6 months of the EEG recording). Up to nine EEG band power features were classiﬁed using linear and non-linear classiﬁers.
Results: Three classiﬁers (artiﬁcial neural networks ANN, support vector machine SVM and linear discriminant analysis LDA) achieved similar average performances, higher than 85\% on a full set of features identifying patients at risk of developing pain and achieved comparably high performance classifying between other groups. With only 10 channels, LDA and ANN achieved 86\% and 83\% accuracy respectively, identifying patients at risk of developing CNP.
Conclusion: Transferable learning classiﬁer can detect patients at risk of developing CNP. EEG markers of pain appear before its physical symptoms. Simple and complex classiﬁers have comparable performance. Signiﬁcance: Identify patients to receive prophylaxic treatment of CNP.},

	abstract = {Not all spinal contusions result in mechanical allodynia, in which non-noxious stimuli become noxious. The studies presented use the NYU impactor at 12.5 mm drop or the Infinite Horizons Impactor (150 kdyne, 1 sec dwell) devices to model spinal cord injury (SCI). Both of these devices and injury parameters, if done correctly, will result in animals with above level (forelimb), at level (trunk) and below level (hindlimb) mechanical allodynia that model the changes in evoked somatosensation experienced by the majority of people with SCI. The sections are as follows: 1) Mechanisms of Remote Microglial Activation and Pain Signaling in “Below-Level” Central Pain 2) Intracellular Signaling Mechanisms in Central Sensitization in “At-Level” Pain 3) Peripheral Sensitization Contributes to “Above Level” Injury Pain Following Spinal Cord Injury and 4) Role of Reactive Oxygen Species in Central Sensitization in Regional Neuropathic Pain Following SCI. To summarize, differential regional mechanisms contribute to the regional chronic pain states. We propose the importance of understanding the mechanisms in the differential regional pain syndromes after SCI in the chronic condition. Targeting regional mechanisms will be of enormous benefit to the SCI population that suffer chronic pain, and will contribute to better treatment strategies for other chronic pain syndromes.},
